              question="How often should commercial windows be replaced?

Older systems can lead to higher energy bills and a significant loss of heat or air conditioning in the summer and winter months in Calgary. Additionally, think about the security of the windows.

              question="What type of glass is used for storefronts?"
              answer="Storefronts are an essential part of any commercial building, as they provide a clear view of the interior and can help to attract customers. The type of glass used in a storefront is important not only for aesthetic reasons, but also for safety and security. Local building codes are a factor for getting the correct type of glass but thick, tempered glass, or laminated glass are popular choices for storefronts and commercial projects due to it's safety. Tempered or laminated glass in 6mm or greater thickness is much less likely to break than standard glass. In the event that tempered glass does break, it will shatter into small, harmless pieces rather than large, dangerous shards. Laminated glass is made by bonding two or more layers of glass together with a plastic interlayer. This type of glass is very strong and resistant to breakage, making it an ideal choice for high-traffic areas.

It is typically made from tempered or laminated safety glass, which is designed to resist breakage.
