        mainContent="Home window repair and replacement is a common need in Calgary. There are many reasons why windows may become damaged and need to be replaced. The most common cause of window damage in Calgary is severe weather, damage caused by others, or they have simply outlasted their service life. We know Calgary's weather can produce the high winds that can break glass, or the  hail that can cause cracks or chips or even outright breakage to the degree of weather penetration... very serious problems indeed!! These issues and others we haven't even mentioned means it is important to have a go-to home window repair Calgary company for your home or business that can also help when hail damage or other repairs are needed. Even common occurrences like our extreme cold can cause glass to become brittle and break or even “fail” and loose their insulating capacity. Hockey pucks, sling shots, baseball games, not so good golf shots or other debris can cause unexpected window and glass damage, as unintentional as they may be. If you have damage to your windows, it is important to contact your reputable Calgary window repair contractor as soon as possible. At KLAAD Glass, we will be able to assess the damage and recommend the best course of action. In some cases, the damage may be minor and a little TLC or home window replacement Calgary is all that is needed. However, if the damage is extensive, we are the people to talk to. Regardless of the extent of the damage, it is important to have it addressed as soon as possible to avoid further damage to your home."

                <p>
                  Residential window replacement cost Calgary can vary depending
                  on a number of factors, such as the size and style of the
                  window, the type of glass, and even the frame material. With
                  the cost of raw materials changing seemingly daily, it is even
                  more important to click on our FREE ESTIMATE link if you have
                  a problem. We can come to you at a time that best suites YOUR
                  schedule and help you access the REAL COSTS, in their
                  entirety, with no surprises. We're home owners too, and we
                  hate surprises. When considering the cost of window
                  replacement, it is important to factor in ALL the costs and be
                  confident that your window costs will be as quoted, and NEVER
                  any more. At KLAAD Glass we will include window supply cost,
                  window installation cost, all materials costs and even getting
                  rid of your old windows, all included in one quote, just so
                  you will know the full price upfront without any hidden
                  charges. Let's be perfectly upfront... overall, the cost of
                  residential window replacement can range from a few hundred
                  dollars to several thousand, depending on the scope of the
                  project. We can help you find a quality window at a price that
                  fits your budget.

                <p>
                  We can help with that! If you have ever noticed moisture or
                  fog in your home windows, you are not alone. This is a common
                  problem that is not confined to older homes. New homes can
                  experience “failures” that allow regular moisture in the air
                  to penetrate the window cavity and build up a “fog” that ruins
                  your view, and decreases your home's efficiency, costing you
                  money from heat loss. Our colder climate and extreme
                  temperature swings we experience in Calgary can really add to
                  this problem. If you can not seem to clean your windows no
                  matter how hard you try, the culprit is probably moisture in
                  the glass. The good news is that we at KLAAD Glass fix these
                  problems every single day. We have fixed thousands of sealed
                  units in Calgary over the years and I doubt that we're done
                  yet. If you are experiencing these persistent problems, KLAAD
                  Glass can help by offering you quality, professional window
                  services at a fair price so that with our help, you can enjoy
                  clear, fog-free windows in no time, and restore that beautiful
                  view!

                </h2>
                <p>
                  Are you interested in achieving greater energy efficiency in
                  your Calgary home? You might want to consider Calgary triple
                  pane window upgrades and installation. Triple pane windows are
                  a type of window that has three layers of glass, with an
                  insulating space between each layer. This design helps to
                  prevent heat loss in the winter and keep your home cooler in
                  the summer. As a result, triple pane windows can help you save
                  money on your energy bills and add to the overall comfort of
                  your home. In addition, they can also help to reduce noise
                  pollution and improve the overall aesthetics of your home.
                  Triple Glaze Upgrades will also increase the value of your
                  home and are an attractive alternative if you're selling. A
                  triple glaze upgrade is often a very important part of a
                  buyer's wish list when shopping for a new home and will often
                  be a deciding factor over a similar house with only double
                  glaze products. KLAAD Glass offers triple pane window upgrades
                  and installation services and we always offer competitive
                  rates and quality workmanship.
