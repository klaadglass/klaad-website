                <p>
                  There are a few different types of storm doors available on
                  the market, each with their own benefits. The most popular
                  type of storm door is the full-view storm door, which offers a
                  clear view of the outdoors while still providing protection
                  from the elements. These doors are typically made of glass or
                  clear plastic, and they can be installed on any type of door.
                  Another type of storm door is the half-view storm door, which
                  offers a partially obstructed view of the outdoors. These
                  doors are typically made of wood or metal, and they can be a
                  great option for doors that are located in high-traffic areas.
                  There are also sliding storm doors, which offer a full view of
                  the outdoors and are typically used for rear home entrances.
                  Other types of storm doors we can help repair, replace, and
                  install are:

                <p>
                  A storm door is an additional layer of protection for an
                  entrance door. Storm doors usually have a glass panel that can
                  be opened and closed to allow airflow into your home, but also
                  offer an excellent level of weather protection and security in
                  Calgary. Storm doors are installed in front of a residential
                  entrance door and will help in reducing drafts, precipitation
                  build up against the main door and reduce energy costs. Storm
                  doors can also provide an extra layer of security by creating
                  a glass barrier while still allowing airflow on those hot
                  summer days and evenings. Storm doors in Calgary have many
                  benefits from not only improving the look of your home, but
                  improving it's energy efficiency too. Whether you're looking
                  to improve the security of your home or simply want to reduce
                  your energy bills, a storm door is a great option.

                  Storm & screen doors calgary
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Retractable screen doors Calgary have become a popular option
                  to getting more airflow into your home. Retractable screen
                  doors roll up into a small vertical housing on your entrance
                  door and are simply “rolled out” across the door opening when
                  needed. Their advantage is an unobstructed view and airflow
                  into the home as it contains no glass, just screen mesh. These
                  types of screen doors don't have the security advantages of
                  storm doors in Calgary, but they do the trick when security or
                  weather protection are not your primary goals, but airflow
                  is!! If you're looking for a high-quality retractable screen
                  door, KLAAD Glass can help you choose the best fit for your
                  home, and we can even help with the installation as well.
